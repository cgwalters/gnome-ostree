Apps
====

Add glick runtime

Networking
==========

* https://live.gnome.org/OSTree/EverythingInEtcIsABug
  - patch glibc to have /lib/passwd and /lib/shadow
  - This will allow us to have NetworkManager save
    wireless networks to /etc
* Make networking work

Sync up with Fedora
===================

* Pull in systemd
* Continue draining spec files into GNOME Build API that's
  upstreamable

Smoke, integration tests
========================

The main smoke test I want is "does the system show GDM".  Possibly
redirect syslog to the qemu serial console, and check that way?

Integration testing would be fantastic; we need some way to ship over
test code, run it, and then get results.  Look at
http://autotest.github.com/

Build more things in ostbuild
=============================

We should turn the Yocto base into a bootstrap system, rather than a
provider of core.  So for example, while Yocto may build udev, we
should rpm -e it before committing to the base tree.
